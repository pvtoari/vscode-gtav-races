# VS Code GTA V Races

## 🛑 It's time to stop.

Don't you think that is unfair not being the the guy talking on TikTok or whatever dopamine source you use, with a cool GTA V car video playing in background?

Now it's your turn to be the guy.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ariel-roque.gtav-races)
2. Run the `GTA V Races: Honey, it's time for your daily dopamine dose!` command from the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `⌘ + ⇧ + P`)
